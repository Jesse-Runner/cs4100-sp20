# Desugaring

Desugaring is the process of expressing more complicated language features in terms of simpler ones. In this chapter, we explain why one would want to desugar and how to go about doing it.

*A note on etymology.* Why is desugaring called "desugaring"? Language features supported primarily for programmer convenience are traditionally called "sugar" (the term is most often applied to syntax, as in "syntactic sugar"). Desugaring is just removing the sugar.
