# PA3: Runtime (WIP)

In this assignment, you'll extend your Grumpy virtual machine to perform garbage collection and to support the creation and management of threads. 

```
                                                   /--------------\
                                                   |GC+Concurrency| <-- PA3
                                                   \--------------/
                                                         |||
                /-------------\                    /--------------\
<filename.s> => | assemble.rs | => <filename.o> => |     vm       | => program's result
                \-------------/                    \--------------/
                  ^| PA1                                 ^| PA2
```

The assignment has two parts. In the first, you will implement a copying garbage collector for your VM from PA2. In the second, you'll extend your garbage-collected VM to support the creation and management of user-level threads. We discuss each part of the assignment in turn. 

## Part I: Garbage Collection

Extend your VM from PA2 to perform copying garbage collection. Refer to Appel 13 and to the lecture notes if you forget exactly how copying collection works. 

For **Part I**, your VM extended with garbage collection will have the same interface as your VM from PA2 except that it may additionally perform garbage collections during the execution of a program. In particular, it should: 

1. Accept the name of a GrumpyVM bytecode `<filename.o>` as its first command-line argument;
2. Execute the file, possibly triggering one or more garbage collections;
3. Print the program's result to `stdout` using the textual encoding described in PA2 (`Vi32(-3)` for the integer `-3`, etc.). 

To make it easy for us to test your garbage collector, we ask that you additionally follow these guidelines:

4. Your VM should trigger a garbage collection *exactly when* the program attempts to `Alloc` an object that would not fit in the heap. For example, if the heap is occupied by `1000` of `1024` possible values (`1024` values being the size of the heap as specified in PA2), and the program attempts to allocate an object of size `25` values, your VM must trigger a garbage collection.

5. On each garbage collection, your VM must print to `stderr` (NOTE: not `stdout`!) exactly the following metadata:

```
GC start: heap_size = X values
GC end: heap_size = Y values
```

where `X` is the number of values in the heap right before the collection and `Y` is the number of values after. 

## Part II: Concurrency (TBD)
