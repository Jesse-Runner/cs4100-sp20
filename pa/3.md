# PA3: Runtime

In this assignment, you'll extend your Grumpy virtual machine to perform garbage collection and to support the creation and management of threads.

```

The assignment has two parts. In the first, you will implement a copying garbage collector for your VM from PA2. In the second, you'll extend your garbage-collected VM to support the creation and management of user-level threads. We discuss each part of the assignment in turn. 

## Part O: VM Revisited

Make sure your VM from the previous assignment is in working order. If you need help, come talk to us in office or lab hours.

## Part I: Garbage Collection

Extend your VM from PA2 to perform copying garbage collection. Refer to Appel 13 and to the lecture notes if you forget exactly how copying collection works. 

For **Part I**, your VM extended with garbage collection will have the same interface as your VM from PA2 except that it may additionally perform garbage collections during the execution of a program. In particular, it should: 

1. Accept the name of a GrumpyVM bytecode `<filename.o>` as its first command-line argument;
2. Execute the file, possibly triggering one or more garbage collections;
3. Print the program's result to `stdout` using the textual encoding described in PA2 (`Vi32(-3)` for the integer `-3`, etc.). 

To make it easy for us to test your garbage collector, we ask that you additionally follow these guidelines:

4. Your VM should trigger a garbage collection *exactly when* the program attempts to `Alloc` an object that would not fit in the heap. For example, if the heap is occupied by `1000` of `1024` possible values (`1024` values being the size of the heap as specified in PA2), and the program attempts to allocate an object of size `25` values, your VM must trigger a garbage collection.

5. On each garbage collection, your VM must print to `stderr` (NOTE: not `stdout`!) exactly the following metadata:

```
GC start: heap_size = X values
GC end: heap_size = Y values
```

where `X` is the number of values in the heap right before the collection and `Y` is the number of values after. 

## Part II: Concurrency

Implement in your VM the following additional instructions:

### Print

Print a character to `stdout`.

Pre-state:

| stack |
| ----- |
| Vi32(i) STACK_TOP |

Post-state:

| stack |
| ----- |
| STACK_TOP |

Side-effect:

Print to `stdout` the ASCII representation of the low-order byte of integer `i`.

### Spawn

Spawn a new thread. 

Pre-state (parent thread):

| stack |
| ----- |
| Vaddr(closure) STACK_TOP |

| heap |
| ---- |
| funptr fv_(N-1) fv_(N-2) ... fv_0 |
| ^closure |

Argument `closure` is the address of a closure in the heap: a function pointer followed by values of the function's free variables at the time the closure was created. 

Post-state (parent thread):

| stack |
| ----- |
| STACK_TOP |

Side-effect:

Create a new child thread with initial state:

| stack | pc |
| ----- | -- |
| Vaddr(closure) Vunit Vloc(0) Vloc(0) STACK_TOP | funptr |

| heap |
| ---- |
| funptr fv_(N-1) fv_(N-2) ... fv_0 |
| ^closure |

The parent thread's heap should be *copied* for the child, at which point the two threads' heaps may diverge (no shared memory).

### Managing and Scheduling Threads

To support `spawn`, update your VM to run multiple threads using a scheduling policy of your choosing (e.g., round robin). Since spawned threads cannot yield to one another (there is no `yield` instruction), your concurrency model should be preemptive. That is, each thread should be allowed to run for only a fixed number of instructions (its "quantum") before scheduling the next thread. You are free to choose quantum.

### Termination and Return Results

Some concurrency models distinguish a "main" thread (e.g., the first one) from the remaining threads, halting the machine when the main thread halts. Your VM should instead halt only when *all* the threads on the machine have halted. The return result of a multithreaded computation in GrumpyVM is the return value of the first thread.

## Extra Credit

For a maximum of one point of extra credit:

* Implement a concurrency primitive like locks or channels.
* Demonstrate at least one test multithreaded program that uses your primitive to communicate between threads.
* In a one page design document, describe your implementation and any pitfalls you encountered along the way.
