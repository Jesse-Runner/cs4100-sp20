# PA2: GrumpyVM

Your job in this assignment is to implement a program `vm.rs` that executes GrumpyVM programs represented in bytecode. That is, `vm.rs` takes programs output by your assembler from PA1 and executes them to produce the result of the corresponding program.

```
                 /-------------\                    /--------------\
<filename.s>  => | assemble.rs | => <filename.o> => |     vm.rs    | => program's result
                 \-------------/                    \--------------/
                   ^| PA1                                 ^| This assignment
```

There are two main problems to solve. 

1. Parsing GrumpyVM bytecode into an internal data structure (of your design)
2. Executing the resulting program. 

As in PA1, your main reference is the [GrumpyVM documentation](), which describes in detail the effect of each instruction on the GrumpyVM.

At a high level, the GrumpyVM operates over:

* A flag `halt` indicating whether the machine has halted
* A register `pc` containing the current program counter, a `u32`
* A register `fp` containing the current frame pointer, a `u32`
* A stack of values `Val`, with maximum size `STACK_SIZE` 
* A heap of values `Val`, with maximum size `HEAP_SIZE`
* The program to be executed, `program`, a list of instructions.

The `pc` points to the instruction to be executed next. The `fp` register points to the location in the stack from which function local variables are loaded and stored (via an offset calculation `fp + i`; see the GrumpyVM documentation for details). 

For the purposes of this assignment, you may assume that `STACK_SIZE` and `HEAP_SIZE` are both equal 1024 bytes. Values `Val` are defined as in the GrumpyVM documentation.

## Example: `push 3`

As an example of how the VM executes an instruction, consider what happens on `push 3`. Schematically, the state of the VM before `push 3` is:

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | i | ... | ... v2 v1 STACK_TOP | ... | ... push 3 ... | 
|       |   |     |                     |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

After `push 3`, we get the following VM state

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | i+1 | ... | ... v2 v1 Vi32(3) STACK_TOP | ... | ... push 3 ... | 
|       |     |     |                             |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

in which the `pc` has been incremented by 1 (to point to the next instruction in the program) and the 32-bit signed integer `3` has been pushed onto the stack.
