# PA2: GrumpyVM

Your job in this assignment is to implement a program `vm.rs` that executes GrumpyVM programs represented in bytecode. That is, `vm.rs` takes programs output by your assembler from PA1 and executes them to produce the result of the corresponding program.

```
                 /-------------\                    /--------------\
<filename.s>  => | assemble.rs | => <filename.o> => |     vm.rs    | => program's result
                 \-------------/                    \--------------/
                   ^| PA1                                 ^| This assignment
```

There are two main problems to solve. 

1. Parsing GrumpyVM bytecode into an internal data structure (of your design)
2. Executing the resulting program. 

As in PA1, your main reference is the [GrumpyVM documentation](), which describes in detail the effect of each instruction on the GrumpyVM.

At a high level, the GrumpyVM operates over:

* A flag `halt` indicating whether the machine has halted
* A register `pc` containing the current program counter, a `u32`
* A register `fp` containing the current frame pointer, a `u32`
* A stack of values `Val`, with maximum size `STACK_SIZE` 
* A heap of values `Val`, with maximum size `HEAP_SIZE`
* The program to be executed, `program`, a list of instructions.

The `pc` points to the instruction to be executed next. The `fp` register points to the location in the stack from which function local variables are loaded and stored (via an offset calculation `fp + i`; see the GrumpyVM documentation for details). Values `Val` are defined as in the GrumpyVM documentation. For the purposes of this assignment, you may assume that `STACK_SIZE` and `HEAP_SIZE` are both equal 1024 bytes. 

A peculiarity of GrumpyVM is that, unlike most real computers, GrumpyVM's `stack` grows upward from smaller to larger addresses (stacks traditionally grow downward, to lower addresses).

## Example 1: `push`

As an example of how the VM executes an instruction, consider what happens on `push 3`. Schematically, the state of the VM before `push 3` is:

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | i | ... | ... v2 v1 STACK_TOP | ... | ... push 3 ... | 
|       |   |     |                     |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

After `push 3`, we get the following VM state

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | i+1 | ... | ... v2 v1 Vi32(3) STACK_TOP | ... | ... push 3 ... | 
|       |     |     |                             |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

in which the `pc` has been incremented by 1 (to point to the next instruction in the program) and the 32-bit signed integer `3` has been pushed onto the stack. In a bit more detail, the VM's `mainloop` performs the following steps in order:

1. Check whether `halt == true`; if so, exit `mainloop`.
2. Increment the `pc`.
3. Check whether the `pc` is greater than or equal to the program length; if so, raise an error.
4. Execute the instruction at address `pc - 1`.
5. Increment `counter`.
6. Loop to 1.

Importantly, note that the `pc` register is incremented to point to the following instruction before the current instruction (at `pc - 1`) is executed. This may be relevant to your implementation of control-flow instructions like `call`. 

## Example 2: `call`

Consider, as a second example, how GrumpyVM's state changes when a `call` instruction is executed. 

Before the call, the state looks like:

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | i | cur_fp | ... varg1 varg2 ... vargN Vloc(caller_fp) Vloc(target) STACK_TOP | ... | ... call ... | 
|       |   |        | ... ^cur_fp                                                      |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

The `call` expects the arguments to be on the stack beginning at address `cur_fp`, followed by two locations: `caller_fp`, the saved frame pointer of the caller, and `target`, the address of the function to be called.

After the call, the state looks like:

| halt | pc | fp | stack | heap | program |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| false | target | cur_fp | ... varg1 varg2 ... vargN Vloc(caller_fp) Vloc(i+1) STACK_TOP | ... | ... call ... | 
|       |        |        | ... ^cur_fp                                                   |     | ... ^i'th instruction ... |

1. `target` has been popped.
2. `pc` has been set to `target`.
3. The location `i+1` (pointing to the instruction right after the `call`) has been pushed onto the stack; this is the address to which the function will return when it executes a `ret`. 

## Specifics

Specifically, your tasks in this assignment are to:

1. Implement a program `vm.rs` that reads and executes GrumpyVM bytecode files `<filename.o>` according to the GrumpyVM specification given in [GrumpyVM documentation](). 

2. On errors, your program should exit with error code 1.

3. When it successfully executes a `.o` file, your program should write to the file `<filename>.result` the program's result value, encoded as described below.

### Value Encoding

When printing the results of GrumpyVM programs, use the following serialization scheme: 

1. The unit value should be printed as "Vunit".
2. An `i32` value should be printed as "Vi32(n)" where "n" is a string encoding the integer `n`, e.g., "-345".
3. The boolean `false` should be encoded "Vbool(false)".
4. The boolean `true` should be encoded "Vbool(true)".
5. The undefined value should be encoded "Vundef".

The other value types `Vsize` and `Vaddr` are used internally by the GrumpyVM but do not appear in programs and will not appear as the results of programs; you therefore do not need to serialize them.
