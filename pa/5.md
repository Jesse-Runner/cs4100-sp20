Your jobs in this assignment are to: 

0. Fix your code from [PA4](4.md) (3 EC points).

1. Implement [tailcall optimization](../doc/tail-recursion.md) in your compiler (1 EC point).

If you complete both parts, you'll receive up to 4 points of extra credit to be applied to your overall homework grade. If you complete just part 0, you'll receive up to 3 EC points applied to your homework grade.

**NOTE: No late days will be accepted (even if you have some left) on this extra credit assignment.**

## Specifics

The specific instructions for Part 0 are exactly the same as in [PA4](4.md).

For Part 1 (tailcall optimization): 

* Update your compiler so that it optimizes tail recursion to use constant stack space as described in [Tail Recursion](../doc/tail-recursion.md).

* Make sure your optimizing compiler passes all the previous test cases from [PA4](4.md).

* Make sure you additionally pass: 

```
tailcall.gpy
tailcall-fact.gpy
```

and that your compiler is producing constant-space code.

* In your README, include a short section on how you approached implementating tail recursion. For example, what changes did you make to your compiler? Include some before/after Grumpy assembly `.s` code examples for the test cases above to convince us that your optimized programs actually use constant stack space.

## Submission

1. You must use one of the following languages to implement your compiler: Rust, C, C++, Python, OCaml. In order for us to support submissions in multiple languages, *all* submissions must contain at least the following files:
   
   ```
   README               <-- A short text document describing your project's architecture
   Makefile             <-- The Makefile used to build your project
   Cargo.toml           <-- If you use Rust+Cargo
   main.<rs|c|cc|py|ml> <-- Your project's root file
   ```
   
   NOTES:
   * Your `Makefile` should contain the following targets:
      - `build`: build your compiler (for Python projects, this target can be a noop but must still exist)
      - `test`: runs your unit tests
      - `run`: run your compiler; it should be called as `F=<file.gpy> make run`
      - `clean`: remove stale files
   * We will build your project on `pu2.cs.ohio.edu` (we suggest you test there).
   * You may (optionally) include additional files that are called from `main`.
   * For Rust projects, you may use Cargo. However, you still need to provide the above `Makefile`.
      - Hint: Try `cargo build --release`. It optimizes and removes debug symbols so produces faster code.
      - You should also submit your Cargo.toml so your project actually builds when we run `make build`
   * Sample `Makefile`s for C++ and Rust will be uploaded to Blackboard. Feel free to reuse or adapt them.
   
 2. To submit your project, submit all your project files separately in Blackboard, under assignment `pa4`, on or before the due date.
