# PA0: Intro. to Rust

Your goal in this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Rust, the programming language we'll be using for the remainder of the course. To do so, you'll implement a couple small programs, first a Reverse Polish Notation calculator (about which more below); then a [SECOND PROGRAM].

Before you get started, make sure you've completed the reading for the first two weeks of the course -- Chapters 1-6 and 8 of [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html).

## Task 1: Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

A Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator uses a stack to perform arithmetic operations expressed in so-called *post-fix* style -- the operation to be performed appears after, or *post*, the operands on which the operation is executed.

For example, here's a valid input to an RPN calculator like the one you'll be building in this assignment:

```
1 2 + done
```

the result of which is `3`. At the level of an underlying stack operation of an RPN calculator, this program executes roughly the following pseudocode:

| Operation | Stack |
| --------- | ----- |
| push 1    | [1]   |
| push 2    | [1; 2] |
| y = pop   | [1]   |
| x = pop   | []    |
| push (x + y) | [3] |

The **Stack** column depicts the stack (with head to the right) *after* the **Operation** listed directly to the left.

Here's a slightly longer RPN program

```
1 2 + 4 + 5 - 6 7 8 * + + 
```

 and its associated trace of stack operations:

| Operation | Stack | Variables |
| --------- | ----- | --------- |
| push 1    | [1]   | |
| push 2    | [1; 2] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | [] | x = 1, y = 2 |
| push (1 + 2) | [3] | |
| push 4    | [3; 4] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | [] | x = 3, y = 4 |
| push (x + y) | [7] | |
| push 5    | [7; 5] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | [] | x = 7, y = 5 |
| push (x - y) | [2] | |
| push 6       | [2; 6] | |
| push 7       | [2; 6; 7] | |
| push 8       | [2; 6; 7; 8] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | [2; 6] | x = 7, y = 8 |
| push (x * y) | [2; 6; 56] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | [2] | x = 6, y = 56 |
| push (x + y) | [2; 62] | |
| y = pop, x = pop | []  | x = 2, y = 62 | 
| push (x + y) | [64] | |

### Your Task 

Implement a calculator for arithmetic programs written in RPN style, as specified by the following grammar:

```
Binary Operators
b ::= + | - | * | /
 
Terms
t ::= n       //32-bit signed integers, e.g., -1, 2, 256, 0, ...
    | b       //Binary operator
    | save    //Pop from the main stack, pushing the value onto an auxiliary stack 
    | restore //Pop from the auxiliary stack, pushing the value onto the main stack

RPN Programs
p ::= t_0 t_1 ... t_n done
```

That is, a valid RPN program is a series of `n` terms, `t_0 t_1 ... t_n`, followed by the keyword `done`. Both the example programs given above are valid according to this grammar. 

The special commands `save` and `restore` allow the programmer to save values on the calculator's main stack onto an auxiliary stack for later computation. For example, here's a program that calculates the sum of two numbers, then uses `save` and `restore` to subtract the result from 0.

```
7 8 + save 0 restore - done
```

In the stack trace for this program below, I've left out the `pop`s and variables to make things a bit more concise.

| Operation | Main Stack | Auxiliary Stack | 
| --------- | ---------- | --------------- | 
| push 7    | [7]        | [] | |
| push 8    | [7; 8]     | [] | |
| push (7 + 8) | [15]    | [] | |
| save 15   | []         | [15] | |
| push 0    | [0]        | [15] | |
| restore 15| [0, 15]    | [] | |
| push (0 - 15) | [-15]  | [] | |


The special term `done` must appear at the end of every valid RPN program, and has the effect of printing out the top value on the main stack (if any), then terminating the program.

### Specifics

1. Construct a test-case RPL program, then post it to Piazza under the label **pa0**. Ensure that your test program is valid according to the grammar above and unique (i.e., that it wasn't previously posted by another student -- note that this policy encourages you to post your test case early, before many other students have already posted). Posting a novel test case is worth roughly 10% of your grade on this part.

2. Write a program, `rpl.rs`, that reads RPL programs on `stdin` and prints their results on `stdout`, assuming the keyword `done` is encountered. Your program may assume, as in the grammar above, that the terms in each RPL program are whitespace-separated.

3. When printing the result of a valid RPL program, include no newline characters (hint: use `print!` instead of `println!`).

4. On valid RPL programs, your RPL interpreter should return exit code `0`. On invalid RPL programs (those that attempt to perform operations without sufficient arguments for example), your interpreter should return exit code `1`.

5. Before the due date, submit your program `rpl.rs` on Blackboard.
