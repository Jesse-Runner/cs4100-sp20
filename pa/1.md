# PA1: Assembler

Your job in this assignment is to implement an assembler for Grumpy assembly code. That is, you'll be implementing a program `assemble.rs` that reads assembly code for the Grumpy virtual machine (GrumpyVM) and outputs corresponding bytecode. There are three main problems to solve: 

1. Translating Grumpy assembly into an in-memory data structure (of your design)
2. Laying out the parsed program in memory in order to resolve labels
3. Printing the resulting bytecode

We discuss each in turn.

## Parsing 

The input to your assembler is a file `<filename>.gpy` containing text like: 

```
SAMPLE GRUMPY ASSEMBLY PROGRAM
```

This program: 
* does this
* then that
* then that.

The output should be a new binary file `<filename>.o` containing the bytecode for the program above, e.g.:

```
CORRESPONDING BYTECODE
```

Note that integers, which are four bytes, are encoded in big-endian style. In general, details of the encoding of instructions and their arguments can be found in the [GrumpyVM documentation](). 

Formally, we define valid Grumpy assembly programs by the grammar:

```
Unary Operations
u ::= 

Binary Operations
b ::=

Instructions
i ::= 

Grumpy Assembly Programs
p ::= i_1
      i_2 
      ... 
      i_N
```

Your assembler should be able to handle any assembly program that is valid according to this grammar.

## Resolving Labels

TODO

## Printing the Bytecode

Once you've parsed and resolved the labels in a particular Grumpy assembly program, it should be relatively straightforward to print out the resulting bytecode. 

## Specifics

1. Post at least one novel test case to Piazza, as in PA0.

2. Implement a program `assemble.rs` that reads Grumpy assembly programs from `<filename>.rs` and outputs the resulting bytecodes to `<filename>.o`. You can assume that `<filename>.rs` is the first argument to `assemble` (the zeroth being your assembler's path).

3. On valid Grumpy assembly programs, `assemble.rs` should return exit code 0. On invalid programs, your assembler should exit with error code 1.
