# PA4: IR

Your job in this assignment is to write a program, `compile`, that translates programs in an intermediate representation, [GrumpyIR](../doc/ir.md), to [GrumpyVM](../doc/vm.md) assembly code.

**Example:** Consider the following program `fib.gpy` written in GrumpyIR:

```
(fun fib (x i32) -> i32
     (cond (== x 0) 1
           (cond (== x 1) 1
	   	 (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2))))))		 
%
(fib 20)
```

which calculates the 20th Fibonnaci number starting from 1.

Once you've completed PA4, doing the following:

```
> ./compile fib.gpy fib.s
```

should produce in file `fib.s` the following an assembly program like:

```
setframe 0
push Lmain
call
halt
Lmain:
push 20
push Lfib
setframe 2
swap
call
ret
Lfib:
push 0
var 0
binary ==
push _L3
branch
push 1
var 0
binary ==
push _L1
branch
push 2
var 0
binary -
push Lfib
setframe 2
swap
call
push 1
var 0
binary -
push Lfib
setframe 2
swap
call
binary +
push true
push _L2
branch
_L1:
push 1
_L2:
push true
push _L4
branch
_L3:
push 1
_L4:
ret
```

Your compiler may produce different code than the above. What matters is that it produces assembly code that behaves the same as the original GrumpyIR program, a notion we make precise below. 

## Specifics

1. Write a program, `./compile <file.gpy> <file.s>`, that compiles GrumpyIR programs in `<file.gpy>` to equivalent GrumpyVM assembly programs in `<file.s>`.

2. **Equivalent** means that the assembly programs you produce should halt (if the original GrumpyIR program did) with the source GrumpyIR program's result as the sole value on the stack.

3. This is a pair assignment. You may work with up to one other person. Only one person need submit. Both partners' names must be in your README.

4. You can test your compiler on the `.gpy` files we've added to the `/tests` directory for this assignment. One possible testing procedure is to compile each `.gpy` file to a `.s` file, then assemble and run the resulting code on your VM, making sure you get the `.expected` result.

5. Submit as individual files on Blackboard before the due date at least the following:

```
README 
Makefile       
main.<rs|c|cc|py|ml> 
```

Your solution may include additional files. Submit them as well if required. We will build and test your code on `pu2.cs.ohio.edu`.

## Suggested Implementation Strategy

We recommend you implement this assignment in the following stages:

### Lexing 

Build a program that lexes input `.gpy` files into a series of tokens. Use either a lexer generator (like `flex` for C) or build your lexer by hand, probably relying on a regular expression library.

### Parsing 

The [GrumpyIR syntax](../doc/ir.md) was designed to be easy to parse (it's basically just S-expressions). We recommend that you build a recursive descent parser by hand following our demonstrations in lecture.

### Generating Assembly Code

Use the lecture notes on [code generation](../doc/codegen.md) to guide you as you generate assembly code (recursively) from GrumpyIR programs. Start small, generating code first for expressions with no variables, then for expressions with variables and `let`s, then for complete programs with functions, etc. Test your code generator at each step, by actually running in your VM the code that you're producing.
